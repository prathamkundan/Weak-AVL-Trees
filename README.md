# Rank Balanced Weak AVL Trees
CS201- Project on WAVL Tree <br />
This project is part of Academic Course , CS201 - Data Structure and Algorithms , Academic Year : 2021-22 , Fall Semester( August - December ) in Indian Insititute of Technology, Ropar , India
<br />  
In this project, Our team has implemented an relatively new data strucuture known as WAVL Tree from scratch and operation such as Insertion and deletion in it.
<br/> 
When you compile the code , a menu will open which will guide the user to select actions and perform those functionalities.  
Example:
Input: 12, 3, 10, 19, 7  
If we follow WAVL Tree balancing rules,  we should get a perfect binary tree    
Output : 3->1 7->0 10->2 12->1 19->0

Our Inorder Traversal gives the output in this form  " < value of node > -> < rank of node > "
